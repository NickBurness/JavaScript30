# JavaScript30

All projects within this repository are my very best attempts towards @wesbos's JavaScript30 challenge.  
No frameworks, no libraries, no compilers or boilerplates. Just pure vanilla JS.  
I would recommend anyone currently learning web development, specifically JavaScript to try it too.   
You can learn more about this 30 day challenge here. https://javascript30.com/
